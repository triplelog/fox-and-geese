Unless you are an expert in XSL and doing weird things with CSS, you probably just want to download the build.zip file, unzip, start a server, and then go to the index.html file. Or just go to the js13k gallery and play.

I will eventually write a blog post or two about how the game works. And I will likely modify the game to be more flexible without the constraints of the JS13k contest.
